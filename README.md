## About

This repository implements the model for saliency-conditioned image generation developed for my senior thesis at Amherst College. This model transforms mappings of visual saliency into artificially generated images with the same saliency distribution.

## Dependencies

In the root directory of this repository, execute:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Note that this repository requires TensorFlow 1.13. 

- Training or evaluating a model requires a system with a GPU. For more details, see [Training](#training).

This model would not be possible without the work of many others in developing saliency predictors and image generation models. In particular, I use code from the following papers and repositories:
